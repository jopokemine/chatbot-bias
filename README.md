## Research Question: Can Chatbots Truly Be 'Unbiased'?

This project aims to answer the above question by subjecting multiple chatbots, trained over many different types of dataset, to the Implicit Association Test (IAT), which can be found [here](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/). This repository shows the code used to load the datasets, train chatbots and test them, using an Textual User Interface (TUI).

*Note*: The original research question for this project was "Can Adding Bias to a Machine Make it more believable?". As part of this, a basic Flask server was coded in order to later facilitate the completion of online Turing Tests to test the believability of the chatbots made. However, the research question changed before I had figured out how to use Flask properly, and thus well before this server was completed. The code has been left, as an insight into how the code was planned to be structured, and how I was learning Flask, before the change.

Because of the change the only files of note are in `main.py` and the `chatbot` folder, all other files were discontinued for this project!

## Usage

First, download the repository:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/jopokemine/Dissertation.git
```

Next, you will need to download the datasets, which can be found under the datasets heading.

Once the datasets are installed into the datasets folder, run the following to train a chatbot:

``` bash
python3 main.py -tr -d [datasets]
```

And the following to test a chatbot:

``` bash
python3 main.py -te -d [datasets]
```
